Reduce number of xapi DB calls in plugin

When there are lots of PIFs in a XenServer/XCP pool, for example when
there are many VLANs configured on the pool, operations such as PIF.get_all
and loops over all PIFs which include database operations, are very
inefficient when executed on a pool slave, and should be avoided
as much as possible. This patch reduces the number of database calls in the
update function of the openvswitch-cfg-update xapi plugin.
